# 42-c2-so_long
A 2D game created using MinilibX

## **How to run**

Compile the code running the `make` command.

Type `./so_long` in the terminal while you are in the same directory as the executable followed by the map name in `.bers` format.

## **Important Notes**
- This project requires LIBFT to compile. Alternatively, custom functions can be replaced with built-in or standard C functions.
- If LIBFT is saved anywhere but its subfolder under the cwd (current working directory), the header file and the Makefile must be updated with the correct paths.
- You will need to implement the image files for visuals and download minilibx-linux from 42

## **Description**
so_long is a 2D minigame utilizing the X-window system to render visuals to the screen. 
The game consists of a player character, collectables, and an exit. If there is more than 1 player character or exit, the game should print an error message and exit cleanly.
